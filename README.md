# Setting Up Your Development Environment
## Essential Tools and Software

Before you can start making your own software, you need to get your computer ready. Here's what you'll need:

- Text Editor - This is where you'll write your code. Some good free options are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). They let you open, edit, and save code files.
- Command Line - This is a way to talk to your computer using text. You'll use it to run programs, add or remove software, and handle files.
- Programming Languages - You'll need to choose a programming language like JavaScript, Python, or Java and install it on your computer.
- Version Control - A tool that will save the history/versions of your codebase. Tools like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) keep track of changes to your code. This is helpful for fixing mistakes and working with others. [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) are two places you can use Git for free.

Some people like to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which puts all these tools together. Some well-known IDEs are Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse. Choose one that works well with the programming language you've picked.
